# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing encompasses a wide range of tasks, each focusing on different aspects of understanding, interpreting, and generating human language. Below is a breakdown of key NLP tasks:

## Text Classification
- Assigning predefined categories to text, such as spam detection, sentiment analysis, and topic labeling.

## Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Identifying and classifying key information in text into categories like names, organizations, locations, etc.

## Part-of-Speech Tagging
- Identifying parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) in a sentence.

## Language Modeling
- Developing models to predict the probability of a sequence of words.

## Machine Translation
- Automatically translating text or speech from one language to another.

## Speech Recognition
- Transcribing spoken language into text.

## Text Generation
- Generating human-like text for applications like chatbots and content creation.

## Sentiment Analysis
- Determining the emotional tone behind a body of text.

## Topic Modeling
- Identifying topics present in a text corpus using techniques like LDA.

## Text Summarization
- Creating concise summaries of longer text documents.

## Question Answering
- Building systems that answer questions posed in natural language.

## Syntactic Analysis (Parsing)
- Analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences.

## Semantic Analysis
- Understanding the meaning conveyed in a text.

## Coreference Resolution
- Identifying when different words refer to the same entity in a text.

## Dialogue Systems and Chatbots
- Developing systems for conversing with humans in natural language.

## Information Retrieval
- Finding relevant information in response to a query, fundamental for search engines.

## Information Extraction
- Extracting structured information from unstructured text.
