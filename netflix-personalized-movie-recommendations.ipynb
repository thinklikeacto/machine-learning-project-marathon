    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "Develop a machine learning model that provides personalized movie recommendations to Netflix users. The system should analyze user preferences and viewing history to suggest movies that align with their tastes and interests. The goal is to enhance user engagement and satisfaction by presenting a curated list of movies that are likely to be of interest to each individual user.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Key aspects of this problem statement include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Personalization**: The system must tailor recommendations to individual users based on their unique preferences and viewing history.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data-Driven**: The recommendations should be based on data, such as user ratings, viewing patterns, and movie metadata (genres, directors, actors, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**User Engagement**: The primary objective is to increase user engagement by suggesting movies that users are likely to enjoy and watch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scalability**: The system should be scalable, capable of handling a large number of users and movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Metrics**: The effectiveness of the system should be measurable using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy of recommendations, user satisfaction, click-through rates).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethical Considerations**: The system should respect user privacy and comply with data usage regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses machine learning algorithms to recommend movies and TV shows based on user preferences and viewing history."
